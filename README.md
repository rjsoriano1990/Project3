# Project3

## Goal

In this project we wanted to be able to graph the average of gas prices based on the **PADD (Petroleum Administration for Defense Districts)** and the date selected by the user.

## The Data

The data we used was from the [**U.S. Energy Information Administration.** ](https://www.eia.gov/dnav/pet/pet_pri_gnd_a_epmr_pte_dpgal_w.htm) We were able to select the data we wanted from there and export it as a csv. After that we cleaned our data using *Jupyter Notebook* and exported it to *SQL*.
